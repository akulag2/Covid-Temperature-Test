# Covid-Temperature-Test
 A Covid Temperature Test JavaScript project is a web application for users to input and validate their body temperature. It assesses the temperature against a fever threshold, indicating potential Covid-19 symptoms. The app may also allow users to report additional symptoms for a more detailed assessment. Based on the inputs, it provides health advice and resources. This tool aids in self-monitoring and raising health awareness.
